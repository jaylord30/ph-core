### Structures: Resource Profiles 

These define constraints on FHIR resources for systems conforming to this implementation guide.

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [PH Core Condition](StructureDefinition-ph-core-condition.md) | Captures Condition. |
| [PH Core Encounter](StructureDefinition-ph-core-encounter.md) | This profile sets minimum expectations for an Encounter resource to record, search, and fetch basic encounter information for a patient. It is based on the [FHIR R4 Encounter](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/encounter.html) resource and identifies the **additional** mandatory core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets that **SHALL** be present in the Encounter when conforming to this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific uses cases in a Philippine context. |

This profile sets minimum expectations for the PractitionerRole resource to record, search, and fetch basic demographics and administrative information about an individual practitioner role in a Philippine context. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets SHALL be present and constrains how the elements are used. It provides the floor for standards development for Philippine use cases. |

It constrains the base FHIR ServiceRequest resource by defining minimum expectations on core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets relevant to local clinical and administrative workflows. It serves as a nationally consistent baseline for recording, searching, and fetching service request information to support interoperable health information exchange across Philippine health facilities and programs. |
