## Artifacts Summary

This page provides a list of the FHIR artifacts defined as part of this implementation guide.

### Structures: Resource Profiles 

These define constraints on FHIR resources for systems conforming to this implementation guide.

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [PH Core Encounter](StructureDefinition-ph-core-encounter.md) | This profile sets minimum expectations for an Encounter resource to record, search, and fetch basic encounter information for a patient. It is based on the [FHIR R4 Encounter](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/R4/encounter.html) resource and identifies the **additional** mandatory core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets that **SHALL** be present in the Encounter when conforming to this profile. It provides the floor for standards development for specific uses cases in a Philippine context. |

This profile sets minimum expectations for the Practitioner resource to record, search, and fetch basic demographics and administrative information about an individual practitioner in a Philippine context. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets SHALL be present and constrains how the elements are used. It provides the floor for standards development for Philippine use cases. |
| [PH Core PractitionerRole](StructureDefinition-ph-core-practitionerrole.md) | The PH Core Practitioner Role Profile inherits from the [FHIR R4 PractitionerRole resource](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/practitionerrole.html); refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile sets minimum expectations for the PractitionerRole resource to record, search, and fetch basic demographics and administrative information about an individual practitioner role in a Philippine context. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets SHALL be present and constrains how the elements are used. It provides the floor for standards development for Philippine use cases. |
