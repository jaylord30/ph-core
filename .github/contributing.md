## 1. How to Submit Issues and Pull Requests?

### **SUBMITTING ISSUES**

#### Before submitting an issue, please ensure the following:

* **Search Existing Issues:** Check if your issue has already been raised. Duplicates will be closed.
* **Provide Clear Details:** When submitting a new issue, include:
  * **Issue Title**: A concise title that summarizes the problem.
  * **Description**: A detailed description of the issue.
  * **Reproduction Steps**: Clear steps to reproduce the problem.
  * **Expected Behavior**: What you expected to happen.
  * **Actual Behavior**: What actually happened, including any error messages or logs.
  * **Environment Details**: If relevant, specify the version of the code and your system details.

#### Issue Label Conventions

Use the following prefixes for issue titles:

| Prefix | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `[BUG]` | Bug reports |
| `[FR]` | Feature Request |
| `-[FR-A]` | Add |
| `-[FR-R]` | Read |
| `-[FR-D]` | Delete |
| `-[FR-U]` | Update |
| `-[FR-O]` | Others |
| `[T]` | Task |

### **SUBMITTING PULL REQUEST**

#### To submit a pull request (PR), follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Create a copy of the repository to your GitHub account by clicking the "Fork" button.

2. **Clone the Fork**: Clone your fork locally to work on your changes.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ph-core.git
   ```

3. **Create a Branch**: Use a meaningful branch name (see [Branching Strategy](#3-branching-strategy)). Use hyphens, not slashes.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat-short-description
   ```

4. **Make Changes**: Implement your changes while following the [Coding Style Guidelines](#2-coding-style-guidelines).

5. **Build and Test Locally**: Run SUSHI and the IG publisher to ensure your changes build correctly.
   ```bash
   # Generate FHIR resources
   sushi .

   # Update publisher (first time or when updates are available)
   ./_updatePublisher.sh  # macOS/Linux
   _updatePublisher.bat   # Windows

   # Build the IG
   ./_genonce.sh  # macOS/Linux
   _genonce.bat   # Windows
   ```

6. **Commit Changes**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Follow the format:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe the changes made"
   ```

7. **Push the Changes**: Push your branch to your forked repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feat-short-description
   ```

8. **Create a Pull Request**: Go to the original repository, click "New Pull Request," and select your branch. Include:
   * A clear description of your changes.
   * A reference to any relevant issues by using `Fixes #(issue-number)`.
   * Test results or any other relevant information.

## 2. Coding Style Guidelines

### **Follow these coding standards to ensure consistency across the project:**

#### FSH (FHIR Shorthand) Guidelines

* **Indentation:** Use 2 spaces for indentation in all FSH files.
* **Line Length:** Limit lines to a maximum of 100 characters.
* **Naming Conventions:**
  * **Profiles:** Use PascalCase (e.g., `PHCorePatient`, `PHCoreEncounter`)
  * **Extensions:** Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `ph-core-religion`)
  * **ValueSets:** Use PascalCase with "VS" prefix (e.g., `PHCorePatientVS`)
  * **CodeSystems:** Use PascalCase with "CS" prefix (e.g., `PHCoreIdentifierCS`)
  * **Instances:** Use camelCase or lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `patient-example-1`)
  * **Aliases:** Use UPPER_CASE for aliases (e.g., `UCUM`, `LOINC`)

#### FSH File Organization

```fsh
// 1. Aliases (if any)
Alias: $loinc = http://loinc.org
Alias: $snomed = http://snomed.info/sct

// 2. Profile/Extension/Logical definition
Profile: PHCorePatient
Parent: Patient
Id: ph-core-patient
Title: "PH Core Patient Profile"
Description: "Philippine Core Patient Profile"

// 3. Rules
* identifier 1..*
* name 1..*

// 4. Invariants (if any)
Invariant: ph-pat-001
Description: "Patient name must include family name"
Severity: #error
```

#### Comments

* Use `//` for inline comments where necessary.
* Add comments for complex rules or business logic.
* Ensure profiles and extensions have clear descriptions.

#### Testing

* Ensure your FSH compiles without errors using `sushi .`
* Provide examples for new profiles.
* Validate the IG builds successfully before submitting a PR.

## 3. Branching Strategy

### **Branch Naming Conventions**

> **Important:** Branch names must **NOT** contain `/` or other special characters that may cause issues with the FHIR auto-IG builder (build.fhir.org).
>
> **Correct:** `feat-create-medication-series`, `fix-patient-profile`, `hotfix-build-error`
> **Incorrect:** `feat/create-medication-series`, `feature/update`, `bug_fix/validator`
>
> The auto-IG builder converts `/` to `-` in URLs, which can cause broken build links and failed IG previews.

### **Main Branches:**

* **main**: This branch contains the latest working code and is where new features are merged before going to production.
* **releases-tag**: These are tagged branches which contains versioned latest production ready code.

### **Feature Branches:**

* Create a feature branch from `main` for new features or bug fixes.
* Use the format: `feat-short-description` (e.g., `feat-patient-profile`, `feat-medication-resource`)
* Merge your feature branch back into `main` when your work is done, and submit a pull request.

### **Hotfix Branches:**

* If an urgent bug needs fixing in production, create a `hotfix-short-description` branch off `main`, fix the issue, then merge it back into `main`.

### **Release Branches:**

* When preparing a new production release, create a `v#.#.#` branch from `main`, after final adjustments and after testing.

## 4. Process for Code Review

### After you submit a pull request, it will go through the following review process:

#### **Automated Checks:**

* Your code will be checked by automated tools (e.g., CI pipeline) for build success, SUSHI compilation, and validation checks.
* Ensure all checks pass before submitting the PR.

#### **Reviewer Assignment:**

* A project maintainer or other contributors will be assigned to review your PR. They will check for:
  * Code correctness and FHIR compliance.
  * Adherence to Coding Style Guidelines.
  * Potential issues with profiles, extensions, or examples.
  * Test coverage and functionality.
  * Correct canonical URLs and identifiers.

#### **Feedback:**

* You may receive feedback or requests for changes. Please address the comments by pushing additional commits to the same branch.
* For any non-code changes requested (e.g., documentation or formatting), make sure to fix them.

#### **Approval:**

* Once the review is complete and all feedback is addressed, the reviewer will approve the PR.

#### **Merging:**

* After approval, the PR will be merged into the target branch `main`.
* The PR will be **squash merged** to maintain a clean commit history.

#### **Post-Merge:**

* After the merge, ensure any linked issues are automatically closed by the PR.
* Delete the feature branch after merge.

#### **Reviewer Checklist**

* Does the IG build locally and in CI?
* Are new artifacts linked in the IG?
* Are identifiers and canonical URLs correct?
* Are changes documented in PR notes?
